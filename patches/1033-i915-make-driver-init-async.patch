Subject: [PATCH 1033/1132] i915: make driver init async

Making i915 driver init async will help much on boot time, which
will also help to meet the tough GP2.0 boot time target,

The patch has been submitted to upstream half a year ago, and after
discussing many rounds, no technical issue/open was left. Though
it's not merged yet, it still means the quality of the patch passed
the reviews of upstream.
