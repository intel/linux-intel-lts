Subject: [PATCH 0918/1132] drm/i915: fix a kernel panic issue of plane
 restriction

When plane restriction feature enabled in sevice os, there could be the
case that there're some CRTC's without a primary plane. If we don't
assign any plane of pipe A to sos, like i915.avail_planes_per_pipe
=0x000F00, it will cause kernel panic when booting because it assumes
primary plane existing in intel_find_initial_plane_obj().

Added a check to the primary plane in CRTC to avoid such kind of issue.
