controller method to set the calcuated trasport params
based on audio stream configuration.

SoundWire:Intel: Add API to allocate port

Intel master controller supports bi-directional port
which can be configured either as Source or Sink ports.
This API provides funtionality to dynamically allocate
ports for audio streaming. It picks up the free port
attaches the ALH stream to it and returns. This is called
by ASoC platform driver for port allocation for streaming.

SoundWire:Intel: Add support for ALH stream to port mapping.

This patch adds functionality to allocate the ALH stream and
map it to the master controller. There can be one-to-one mapping from
ALH stream to Port. Function takes care of allocating PCM stream
v/s PDM stream based on the calling function requirement.
