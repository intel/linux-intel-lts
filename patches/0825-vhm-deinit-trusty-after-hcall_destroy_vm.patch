Subject: [PATCH 0825/1132] vhm: deinit trusty after hcall_destroy_vm

after deinit_trusty, the released cma memory could be used by other drivers.
while EPT of this memory area need be remap back to SOS by hcall_destroy_vm.
with current sequence, an access to EPT unmapped area will cause MMIO access
error.

for trusty creation, the sequence is like:
hcall_create_vm
->
init_trusty (allocate CMA for trusty memory)
....>
UOS hypercall to create trusty world (EPT remapping etc)

for trusty destroy, the sequence changed like below:
hcall_destroy_vm (include trusty destroy - EPT remapping back etc)
->
deinit_trusty (free CMA for trusty memory)

this sequence looks a little confuse, but as hcall_destroy_vm combined trusty
world destroy operation, we need this operation be done before deinit_trusty.
