 *  Created Virtqueue APIs for ACRN VBS framework:
 *  - VBS-K is a kernel-level virtio framework that can be used for
 *    virtio backend driver development for ACRN hypervisor.
 *  - Virtqueue APIs abstract away the details of the internal data
 *    structures of virtqueue, so that callers could easily access
 *    the data from guest through virtqueues.

 * Walk descriptor table and put requests into iovec.
 *
 * Examine the chain of descriptors starting at the "next one" to
 * make sure that they describe a sensible request.  If so, return
 * the number of "real" descriptors that would be needed/used in
 * acting on this request.  This may be smaller than the number of
 * available descriptors, e.g., if there are two available but
 * they are two separate requests, this just returns 1.  Or, it
 * may be larger: if there are indirect descriptors involved,
 * there may only be one descriptor available but it may be an
 * indirect pointing to eight more.  We return 8 in this case,
 * i.e., we do not count the indirect descriptors, only the "real"
 * ones.
 *
 * Basically, this vets the vd_flags and vd_next field of each
 * descriptor and tells you how many are involved.  Since some may
 * be indirect, this also needs the vmctx (in the pci_vdev
 * at vc->vc_pi) so that it can find indirect descriptors.
 *
 * As we process each descriptor, we copy and adjust it (guest to
 * host address wise, also using the vmtctx) into the given iov[]
 * array (of the given size).  If the array overflows, we stop
 * placing values into the array but keep processing descriptors,
 * up to VQ_MAX_DESCRIPTORS, before giving up and returning -1.
 * So you, the caller, must not assume that iov[] is as big as the
 * return value (you can process the same thing twice to allocate
 * a larger iov array if needed, or supply a zero length to find
 * out how much space is needed).
 *
 * If you want to verify the WRITE flag on each descriptor, pass a
 * non-NULL "flags" pointer to an array of "uint16_t" of the same size
 * as n_iov and we'll copy each vd_flags field after unwinding any
 * indirects.
 *
 * If some descriptor(s) are invalid, this prints a diagnostic message
 * and returns -1.  If no descriptors are ready now it simply returns 0.
 *
 * You are assumed to have done a vq_ring_ready() if needed (note
 * that vq_has_descs() does one).
