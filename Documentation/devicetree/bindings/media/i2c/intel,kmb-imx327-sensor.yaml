description: |-
  The Keem Bay imx327 sensor is a Sony CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
  with an active array size of 1937H x 1097V. It is programmable through I2C
  interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.  Image
  data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes at 222.75
  Mbps.

  The sensor can also be probed as platform device and later on registered
  to the I2C bus. Probing as platform device is used when different
  sensors with the same slave address must be able to be attached to one slot.
  They are probed with priority. Example slot with multiple sensors attached
