Subject: [PATCH] xfs: validate cached inodes are free when allocated

commit afca6c5b2595fc44383919fba740c194b0b76aff upstream

A recent fuzzed filesystem image cached random dcache corruption
when the reproducer was run. This often showed up as panics in
lookup_slow() on a null inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks.

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000000
....
Call Trace:
 lookup_slow+0x44/0x60
 walk_component+0x3dd/0x9f0
 link_path_walk+0x4a7/0x830
 path_lookupat+0xc1/0x470

but had many different failure modes including deadlocks trying to
lock the inode that was just allocated or KASAN reports of
use-after-free violations.

The cause of the problem was a corrupt INOBT on a v4 fs where the
root inode was marked as free in the inobt record. Hence when we
allocated an inode, it chose the root inode to allocate, found it in
the cache and re-initialised it.

We recently fixed a similar inode allocation issue caused by inobt
record corruption problem in xfs_iget_cache_miss() in commit
ee457001ed6c ("xfs: catch inode allocation state mismatch
corruption"). This change adds similar checks to the cache-hit path
to catch it, and turns the reproducer into a corruption shutdown
situation.
