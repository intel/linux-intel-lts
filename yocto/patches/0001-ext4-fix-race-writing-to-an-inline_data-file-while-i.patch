Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix race writing to an inline_data file while its
 xattrs are changing

commit a54c4613dac1500b40e4ab55199f7c51f028e848 upstream.

The location of the system.data extended attribute can change whenever
xattr_sem is not taken.  So we need to recalculate the i_inline_off
field since it mgiht have changed between ext4_write_begin() and
ext4_write_end().

This means that caching i_inline_off is probably not helpful, so in
the long run we should probably get rid of it and shrink the in-memory
ext4 inode slightly, but let's fix the race the simple way for now.
