Subject: [PATCH 21/45] ARM: Do not use NOCROSSREFS directive with ld.lld

commit 36168e387fa7d0f1fe0cd5cf76c8cea7aee714fa upstream.

ld.lld does not support the NOCROSSREFS directive at the moment, which
breaks the build after commit b9baf5c8c5c3 ("ARM: Spectre-BHB
workaround"):

  ld.lld: error: ./arch/arm/kernel/vmlinux.lds:34: AT expected, but got NOCROSSREFS

Support for this directive will eventually be implemented, at which
point a version check can be added. To avoid breaking the build in the
meantime, just define NOCROSSREFS to nothing when using ld.lld, with a
link to the issue for tracking.
