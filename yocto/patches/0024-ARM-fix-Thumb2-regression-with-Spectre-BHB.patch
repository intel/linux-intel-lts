Subject: [PATCH 24/45] ARM: fix Thumb2 regression with Spectre BHB

commit 6c7cb60bff7aec24b834343ff433125f469886a3 upstream.

When building for Thumb2, the vectors make use of a local label. Sadly,
the Spectre BHB code also uses a local label with the same number which
results in the Thumb2 reference pointing at the wrong place. Fix this
by changing the number used for the Spectre BHB local label.

Fixes: b9baf5c8c5c3 ("ARM: Spectre-BHB workaround")
