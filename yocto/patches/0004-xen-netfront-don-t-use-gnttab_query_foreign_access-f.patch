Subject: [PATCH 04/11] xen/netfront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access()
 for mapped status

Commit 31185df7e2b1d2fa1de4900247a12d7b9c7087eb upstream.

It isn't enough to check whether a grant is still being in use by
calling gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as a mapping could be realized
by the other side just after having called that function.

In case the call was done in preparation of revoking a grant it is
better to do so via gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() and check the
success of that operation instead.

This is CVE-2022-23037 / part of XSA-396.
