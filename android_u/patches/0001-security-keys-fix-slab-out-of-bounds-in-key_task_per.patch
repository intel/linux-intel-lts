Subject: [PATCH] security/keys: fix slab-out-of-bounds in key_task_permission

[ Upstream commit 4a74da044ec9ec8679e6beccc4306b936b62873f ]

KASAN reports an out of bounds read:

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.
