Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in
 wb_dirty_limits(), again"

commit 30139c702048f1097342a31302cbd3d478f50c63 upstream.

Patch series "mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling".

Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into
32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for
more details).


This patch (of 2):

This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.

The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the
default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
div64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
thresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
possible overflow is just moot.
