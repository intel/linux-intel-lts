Subject: [PATCH] net/iucv: fix use after free in iucv_sock_close()

[ Upstream commit f558120cd709682b739207b48cf7479fd9568431 ]

iucv_sever_path() is called from process context and from bh context.
iucv->path is used as indicator whether somebody else is taking care of
severing the path (or it is already removed / never existed).
This needs to be done with atomic compare and swap, otherwise there is a
small window where iucv_sock_close() will try to work with a path that has
already been severed and freed by iucv_callback_connrej() called by
iucv_tasklet_fn().

[452744.125325] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt

Note that bh_lock_sock() is not serializing the tasklet context against
process context, because the check for sock_owned_by_user() and
corresponding handling is missing.

Ideas for a future clean-up patch:
A) Correct usage of bh_lock_sock() in tasklet context, as described in
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/1280155406.2899.407.camel@edumazet-laptop/
Re-enqueue, if needed. This may require adding return values to the
tasklet functions and thus changes to all users of iucv.

B) Change iucv tasklet into worker and use only lock_sock() in af_iucv.
